Data from the pilot and main annotation stages of the project.

The **final, full corpus data** (from the main annotation stage) is located in the [corpus](../corpus) folder.

## Main
The [main](/data/main) folder contains:
- [annotated](/data/main/annotated/): 41 opinions annotated by Michael (exported from INCEpTION in WebAnno TSV format)
- [agreement_study](/data/main/agreement_study): annotations from Michael and Nathan for the agreement study.
- [raw](/data/main/raw): files imported into INCEpTIOn for annotation (space-separated tokens, one sentence per line)
- [processed](/data/main/processed): intermediate data. Right now, this includes copies of the raw files with more informative filenames. Eventually, the raw filenames should be corrected and reimported to INCEpTIOn with their annotations so they can be exported in TSV format, which will standardize all filenames.

## Pilot
The [pilot](/data/pilot) folder contains:
